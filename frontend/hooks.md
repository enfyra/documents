# Hooks System

Hooks are a powerful feature that allows you to inject custom code at specific points in the API request lifecycle. Instead of creating full [Custom Handlers](./custom-handlers.md), you can use hooks to modify requests and responses with minimal code.

**🔗 For complete lifecycle understanding, see [API Lifecycle](../backend/api-lifecycle.md)**

## What are Hooks?

Hooks execute JavaScript code at two key moments:
- **PreHook**: Runs **before** the main operation (before database operations)
- **AfterHook**: Runs **after** the main operation (after database operations)

**Key Advantage**: Hooks share the same context throughout the entire request lifecycle, making them perfect for lightweight modifications without replacing the entire handler.

## When to Use Hooks vs Handlers

### Use Hooks When:
- ✅ **Modify request data**: Transform input before database operations
- ✅ **Add validation**: Check data before processing
- ✅ **Modify query filters**: Change filtering programmatically  
- ✅ **Transform responses**: Format output data after operations
- ✅ **Add logging**: Track operations without changing core logic
- ✅ **Auto-generate fields**: Create slugs, hash passwords, set timestamps

### Use Custom Handlers When:
- ❌ **Complex business logic**: Multi-step operations across multiple tables
- ❌ **Replace entire operation**: Completely different behavior than CRUD
- ❌ **External API calls**: Third-party integrations requiring complex workflows

## The $ctx Context Object

Hooks have access to a shared context object (`$ctx`) that persists throughout the entire API request lifecycle. This context contains request data, database repositories, helper functions, and user information.

**🔗 For complete $ctx documentation and lifecycle details, see [API Lifecycle](../backend/api-lifecycle.md#context-sharing-ctx)**

### Key Context Properties Available in Hooks

```javascript
$ctx = {
  // Request data
  $body: {},           // Request body (can be modified)
  $params: {},         // URL parameters (/users/:id)
  $query: {},          // Query parameters (?limit=10)
  $user: {},           // Current authenticated user
  
  // Database access
  $repos: {            // Auto-generated repositories
    main: repository,  // Main table repository
    users: repository, // Named repositories for target tables
  },
  
  // Utilities  
  $helpers: {          // Helper functions
    $jwt: function,    // Create JWT tokens
    $bcrypt: object,   // Hash/compare passwords
    autoSlug: function // Generate URL slugs
  },
  
  // Logging & sharing
  $logs: function,     // Add logs to response
  $share: {            // Share data between hooks
    $logs: []
  }
};
```

**Important:** The `$ctx` object is the **same reference** across all hooks and handlers in a request. Changes made in preHooks affect afterHooks and handlers.

## Creating Hooks

### Step 1: Access Hooks Management
1. Navigate to **Settings → Hooks** in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create New Hook"** button

### Step 2: Configure Hook
You'll see the hook creation form with these fields:

- **Name**: Descriptive name for the hook
- **PreHook**: JavaScript code that runs before the operation
- **AfterHook**: JavaScript code that runs after the operation  
- **Priority**: Execution order (0 = highest priority)
- **IsEnabled**: Toggle to activate/deactivate the hook
- **Description**: Documentation for the hook's purpose
- **Route**: Click the relation picker to select which route this applies to
- **Methods**: Click the relation picker to select HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

### Step 3: Link to Route and Methods
- **Route Selection**: Use the relation picker to search and select the target route
- **Method Selection**: Use the relation picker to choose which HTTP methods trigger this hook
- **Multiple Methods**: A single hook can apply to multiple HTTP methods on the same route

## Writing Hook Code

For detailed information about writing JavaScript code within hooks, including the context object (`$ctx`), available functions, and comprehensive examples, see:

**➡️ [Hook Development Guide](../backend/hook-development.md)**

This covers:
- Hook context and available variables
- PreHook and AfterHook code examples  
- Database access and utility functions
- Execution flow and priority system
- Best practices and debugging techniques

Hooks provide the perfect balance between simplicity and power, allowing you to customize API behavior without the complexity of full custom handlers.
